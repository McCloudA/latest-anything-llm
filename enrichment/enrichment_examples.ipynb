    "# New Enrichment code\n",
    "\n",
    "The new plan - screw ANythingLLM, just use as much space as we need in a GPT-4 prompt to answer our questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all this code does is the following:\n",
    " - Grab the jobs-database and look for all the jobs that don't have some of the following things:\n",
    "   - A \"re-enrich\" flag (if we don't have this, set a new one and make it \"true\".)\n",
    "   - The extracted-details of \"skills\" (a list of strings) (if we don't have this, pull the text and ask our GPT4 structures for it)\n",
    "   - The extracted-details of \"job_title\" (likewise, extract this)\n",
    "   - Required-certifications (same sort of thing, with whatever is absolutely required, like a degree or a professional cert.)\n",
    "   - If we place the last embedded piece in place (i.e. if we have just added something and all the pieces are now there), set re-encode to \"false\", indicating that we're done.\n",
    " - Do the same for people/the applicant database:\n",
    "   - Again, start with the re-enrich flag\n",
    "   - This one requires us to extract the text from resumes, but otherwise works the same, with skills, education, certifications, and work history.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is intended to get us through this process first - when we're done, we should have everything we need to do the rest of the matching, in a nice structured format, in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is all done, we're going to do the following:\n",
    "  - Make another flag, this one called \"re-embed\", that we will first set to \"True\" if it isn't there already.\n",
    "  - If that flag is true, then construct a standardized narrative about the job/resume, like the following: \"The job title is <desired job/job title>.  This job is similar to other positions , like <last job the person had/repeat the job title>.  The required skills are <person's skills/job required skills>.\"\n",
    "  - If we just made that brief description, embed the person as person_<UID>, or the job as job_<UID>, in our vector DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, every day we will look at the records where the \"last_suggestions\" flag is older than a chosen threshold, or where it doesn't exist.  If so, we'll go to our vector DB, and ask for the nearest 50 or so records to that person, get all the jobs that meet the immutable stuff (need to do some location and certification cuts here), then kick out a latest \"recommended jobs\" file/DB that we can use to do the actual applications."
